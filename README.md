# TEMOA-Italy

## Features

**TEMOA-Italy** is an extension of the **open-source energy system modeling framework** [**TEMOA**](https://temoacloud.com/) (Tools for Energy Modeling Optimization and Analysis). A case study on a Reference Energy System representing the **Italian system** is developed starting from the well-established [TIMES-Italy](https://biblioteca.bologna.enea.it/RT/2011/2011_9_ENEA.pdf) model.

The developing team includes Prof. L. Savoldi[^1], D. Lerede[^2], M. Nicoli[^2]  @ Energy Department “Galileo Ferraris” @ [**Politecnico di Torino**](https://www.polito.it/). Please, contact us at:
